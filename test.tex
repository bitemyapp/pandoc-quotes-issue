\section*{Notes for My Paper}

Don't forget to include examples of topicalization.
They look like this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{func "Hello World"}
\item \texttt{func "Hello" "World"}
\item \texttt{func [1, 2, 3] "a, b, c"}
\item \texttt{func ["Hello", "World"]}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Mood}

Mood changes when there is a topic, as well as when
there is WH-movement.  \emph{Irrealis} is the mood when
there is a non-subject topic or WH-phrase in Comp.
\emph{Realis} is the mood when there is a subject topic
or WH-phrase.
